# A3 Use Case group 22

### 3A: Analyse use case
1. Goal: Goal of the tool / workflow in one sentence. i.e. to support the user to calculate the total total cost of the project.
2. Model Use (Bim Uses): Please refer initially to the Mapping BIM uses, use cases and processes section in this document.


### 3B: Propose a (design for a) tool / workflow
3. Process: model the process diagram from your use case in BPMN.io please remember to save the .bpmn file and you can save a .svg file that you can insert into your report. 
4. description of the process of your tool / workflow.


### 3C: Information exchange
5. Information Exchange: Fill out the excel template with the information for your planned tool / workflow. For this you will need access to the excel, and the Dikon document to help you specify the LOD (LOR,LOG,LOI) for each element you need for you tool / workflow. This can get confusing - don’t worry we can help 😊
6. IFC: Describe the IFC entities and properties for each of the elements you identified in your information exchange. Describe the data that you need to:
	* Find in the IFC
	* Find in an external sources i.e. BR18
	* Based on assumptions (useful when we don't have the 'real' data that we need for our tool)



### 3D: Value What is the potential improvement offered by this tool?
This is the common question when developing tools and processes as an [intrapreneur]( https://hbr.org/2020/03/why-you-should-become-an-intrapreneur) in a company. You should consider the business and societal value of this tool – does it save time to the company, does it make employees happier / more productive? Could it reduce material use in society?

7.	Describe the business value (How does it create value for your business / employer)
8.	Describe the societal value (How does it make the world better)

* N.B. If it doesn't do either of these things (ideally it should do both - don't do it!!)


### 3E: Delivery
In this assignment we will focus on the input data that you need for your final tool / workflow. 
9. Your tool/workflow: Description of how your tool / workflow would solve the use case
10. Delivery: Description of how you would make the tool / workflow - what steps would you go through?
